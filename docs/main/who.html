            My name is Amy (she/her), I'm 23, and I live in the DC area. I'm a DevOps/Platform engineer and a UMD grad. I work for 
            Verisign, so I am very excited about owning a domain for the first time. That's my industry! If you want to read more 
            about who I am professionally, please take a look at my LinkedIn. In my free time, I like listening to and playing music
            (I'm a recovering band kid), birdwatching, and I hope to do some more writing vis-a-vis this website.
