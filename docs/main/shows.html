                        There is nobody quite like Geordie Greep. What a name, what a phenomenal guitarist, what a delightfully off-putting bearing.
                        He is a truly special talent and his touring band is outstandingly tight. My socks were knocked off.

                        wandering around the stage. It was just 2 dudes and a lot of backing tracks. I was a little 
                        underwhelmed but still enjoyed their set. AND KNOCKED LOOSE!! MAN THEY ARE CRAZY!!! I did have a 
                        really scary experience in the mosh pit (got crushed) but stayed safe and had a good time. Many flailing

                        cry several times.. this was the first show I cried at, I think. That album was 
                        very formative for me, ok. Bonus detail: my feet were sopping 
                        wet because it rained on the way to the metro and I had to "aerate" my feet by taking my shoes off 
                        during Smashing Pumpkins' set. Also, yes, this picture was taken through binoculars.

                        DIIV is one of the best live acts I've ever seen. WOW! Those tracks are made to be heard live. 
                        Albums, good. Live show, world-class. They are so loud that you can feel the music in your body. 
                        They also had these hilarious and bizarre interludes with people making the following claims among 
                        others: DIIV set will cause you to transcend and become a whole new person afterwards; All of your 
                        problems will be solved if you buy DIIV merch; DIIV will endorse any political candidate, DIIV is 
                        partnered with "exxón mobíl". But, yeah, the control they have over their live sound is absolutely 
                        crazy. Horse Jumper of Love sounded good but for some reason the lead singer faced to the left instead of 
                        towards the crowd.

                        I got so sweaty. Guitarist at one point broke FOUR of his strings and had to borrow the 
                        opener's guitar for the rest of the set. PUNK ROCK!! "Running" with the mosh-quito is such a treat 
                        and I love all their paper-mache props. And also I almost died on the way home. BUT I DID NOT!!

                        LOTS to say about this show. 1) I didn't think I was going until day of. I bought tickets from a 
                        random guy off Reddit at face value. 2) BOB POLLARD HAS STILL GOT IT. Everyone talking about 
                        Taylor Swift 3 hour show. Nobody talking about Bob Pollard (age 66) two hour show. Show was LONG. 
                        He's like a genetically engineered frontman. And he had like 5 beers. 3) This was the worst crowd I 
                        had ever seen until people finally started moving for "Game of Pricks". It seemed like people either 
                        weren't moving at all or they were actively trying to get Bob's attention and have a their own special moment 
                        with him. Lots of older dudes in their work clothes. But it was super fun after "Game of Pricks". 
                        It had started to get a little tedious before that due to the length. Game of Pricks went crazy 
                        though. Definitely a highlight, moshing with those old dudes. 4) Bob passed a bottle of Jose Cuervo 
                        into the crowd and I was the 3rd person to drink from it. So I got to share Bob's germs! It was just 
                        like church. Overall a very, very memorable show.
