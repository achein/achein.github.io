                        There is nobody quite like Geordie Greep. What a name, what a phenomenal guitarist, what a delightfully off-putting bearing.
                        He is a truly special talent and his touring band is outstandingly tight. My socks were knocked off.

                        Really, really fun show. Ovlov sounded great. But, why was everyone in the pit literally 6'5"? There were like 4
                        of the biggest dudes I've ever seen all slamming into each other. Added to the atmosphere though.
