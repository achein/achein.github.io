        <p>
            This website is equal parts a tech exercise and an art project (?), primarily driven by my growing frustrations 
            with social media. I am particularly frustrated with the business of social media, as well as 
            its norms and restrictions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For a long time I have been aware of how big social media platforms, against the best 
            interests of their users, are built to get us to spend more time on our phones. This is so that they can collect 
            and sell more of our data. Of course, I knew this was evil, but I put up with it to catch up with my friends, 
            keep up with my community, and see some funny videos. However, recently, Mark Zuckerberg has started rolling back 
            protections for LGBT+ people on his platforms and using misogynistic rhetoric in interviews. As these things happen I 
            am feeling worse and worse about continuing to use them and putting more money in the pockets of these big tech CEOs like
            Zuckerberg. Boycotting those platforms is much easier said than done, though, because so many people and entities I care 
            about are still using them. I really am not active on any other platform, at least not as myself. Sure, we could all move
            to another platform, but why wouldn't the same thing just happen on another website, with another company? When I make my 
            own website, I'm not beholden to any company, any CEO, any rules. 
        </p>

            I'm also not beholden to any norms here. The point of social media, as it was created, was to
            share things with people you knew, and keep in touch with them. I am observing that people don't use 
            it that way as much anymore. In fact, it would be impossible to use it that way now because of how the developers have changed 
            the platform. Turns out, scrolling few a handful of posts once a day doesn't generate tons of ad revenue. Hmm. 
            So, it has become much more typical to spend time consuming on these platforms than posting. This becomes the social norm.
            Given that, how does posting on these platforms feel? In my opinion, not great! Maybe this is in my head, but because 
            real people don't do it that much, I feel like I'm going out on a limb, or like I'm bothering people. Additionally, 
            what I <i>can</i> post is incredibly limited on Instagram. Pictures only! The website is infinitely customizable. 
            I have full control over my online space, here.

            self-host this website.
